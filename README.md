This tool was developed to make binary masks for anomaly detection dataset.
It was difficult free, simple and light tool and I thought finding a contour for a mask based on cv is enough to generate simple mask rather than ai based segmentation. 
For my case, it works well and easy to use. I'm happy to share this code for others!
